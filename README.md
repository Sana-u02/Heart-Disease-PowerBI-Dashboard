# 💓 Heart Disease Survival Analysis

 This project dives into patient data to uncover insights into survival trends, risk factors, and the impact of conditions like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and more — all through the lens of interactive Power BI dashboards.

## 📊 Overview

This analysis explores:
- Survival rates by age group
- Relationship between survival and ejection fraction
- Impact of serum creatinine levels on outcomes
- Influence of lifestyle and health conditions (e.g., smoking, anemia, diabetes)
- Gender-based differences in survival and risk patterns

## 🚀 Key Findings

- 🧓 People aged **61–70** had the **highest survival rate** (~76%), followed by 51–60 and 40–50 groups.
- 🧬 Lower serum creatinine and higher ejection fraction were associated with better survival.
- 🚬 Smoking, diabetes, and anemia **negatively impact survival**, especially in older age groups.
- 👩‍⚕️ Gender plays a role — analysis included comparison between **male and female** patients.
